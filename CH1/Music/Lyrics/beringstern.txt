It's a wonderful town you belong in
It's a beautiful town where you make friends
Make good choices, it's what you did
That made this town Beringstern

That's what made this town Beringstern

Beringstern, it's a magical town
no one's the best and no one's wearing the crown
It's not about who you are, it's what you do
if you call yourself a hero, I guess that's true

But hey, I know, it's not that fun
but drop all of your weapons and drop all of your guns
I was desperate for money, I always caused harm
But it doesn't hurt to have a little bit of charm.

The clouds drift low with unsolved lore
full with stories growing more and more
From picking up trash to a magical quest
I admit it was hard but it was the best
In Beringstern, that's where it all starts! (In Beringstern)

(I-)
Woke up to the sound of the sky so wide,
Beringstern is glowing, the magic won't hide!
people were screaming, but I was beaming
and I got the chance to be a hero! (A hero!)

And I kept going when I almost burst,
Mind that this is the first chapter,
Every friend, each path I've turned,
All the love in Beringstern.

(All the love in Beringstern)

When you're in danger, we'll come in to help
It's not about the victory, it's about what you do
If we get blown to bits, it'll all be worth it
it'll all be worth it, because we did it for YOU





You can keep going farther
There's not a limit or a border
Keep on trying, work harder,
If it's enough, then break the border.

If you're forced to do it, don't be scared to deny it
You can always try it
Don't destroy just have some joy
and try to have some mercy :]

it's not too late for mercy

It's been really painful, going through all this
But at the end, it turned out it was worth it
Hey, it's not about me, now it's your turn!
Now it's up to you to be the one to save Beringstern.
